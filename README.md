##**Project**'W.A.K'

## Introduction
> This README is for Wizard, Archer, Knight (W.A.K), a hacksprint project at Atlas.
> The purpose of this project was to create an application in C++. I settled on a simple application inspired by the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.
> I decided to use SFML as the graphical backing of the application. This presented many challanges as this was my first time using the Library.
> While the application works, I was not able to implement a score keeping feature or some of the sub-menu ideas I had due to time constraints

### Requirements
- Program must be built in C++

### Tech Used
- Standard C++ Libraries
